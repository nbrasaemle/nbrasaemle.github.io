                            My name is Nicole Brasaemle. I was born in Mounds View, MN, and I have lived there all my life except for when I was in college.
                            I went to the local public schools, and in high school, I was a member of the Irondale Marching Knights. 
                            After high school I went to the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. I declared a major my sophmore year in Geology and a minor in Mathematics. 
                            I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Geology in May of 2017.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I am currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota's Full-Stack Web Development Coding Boot Camp.
                            In this boot camp I am learning to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. 
                            I have experience in sales and managing. I currently work in retail.
                            I have had some programming experience in Java, prior to this boot camp, and I have enjoyed the boot camp so far.
                            I hope to work with computers, programming, or web development when finished with this boot camp.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            When I am not coding, I like to spend time with my family and our dogs, go hiking at local and state parks, and read.
                            I also enjoy watching movies, tv, and playing video games for the PC, Wii, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS. 
                            My absolute favorite game is "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" made by Bethsaida; my favorite movie series is "The Lord of the Rings", specifically "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers".
                            I  also have a passion for ceramics and pottery, painting, knitting, and crocheting.
