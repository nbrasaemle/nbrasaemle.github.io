  # Employee Data Management - Push

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Using your newfound knowledge of the `.push({})` method, create the code necessary to push employee data into the database upon clicking the `submit` button on your webpage.

* **NOTE:** Don't worry about getting the data to display in the HTML just yet. Just focus on getting data pushed to the database.

* If you finish early, begin reading about `.on("child_added")` in the Firebase documentation and/or the MomentJS library.

# Employee Data Management - Child_Added

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Using your newfound knowledge of the `.on("child_added")` method, begin to retrieve your employee data from the database and populating the records into your table.

* **NOTE:** Don't worry about calculating Months Worked or the Total Billed just yet. Just focus on retrieving the data that is already in the database.

* If you finish easily, continue refining the aesthetics of your website, consider incorporating "update" or "delete" employee buttons, or begin reading up on the MomentJS library.
