        <h2>Bio</h2>

         <p>Celtic Thunder is a Irish singing group, created in 2007 by Sharon Browne, and debuted in August 2007 in Dublin Ireland.  
            They have varied in artists over the years but on average there are five or six current members. 
            In 2011 David Munro joined the group as the Musical Director and has been on every tour of every show since. 
            He has also composed several  original songs and is responsible for musical and vocal arrangements.</p>
       
         <p>They sing all types of genres such as Folk, World, Soft Rock, Broadway, and a few more! 
            They put their own twist on the music they play. 
            Members left the group for different reasons, some for solo careers others for reality shows.
            In March 2014, one of the original five Celtic Thunder principal singers, George Donaldson died of a heart attack.
